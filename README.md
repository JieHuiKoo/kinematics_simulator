# kinematics_simulator

About:
This is a kinematics simulator written in C++ to explore the implementation and principles of:
1) Ackerman Steering
3) Path Pursuit Algorithm
4) Transformation Frames
5) Sonar Sensor Measurements to a known wall

The following libraries are used:
1) OpenCV (For visualisation)<br>
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
3) SDL (For Keyboard Inputs)
```
sudo apt-get -y install libsdl2-dev
```
